# Base Number Conversion

Base convert is a simple web application that I made to help me confirm my mental conversion between decimal, binary, octal, and hexidecimal. 


Styling is bare minimal as I had only intended to use it for myself, but if you feel like you would like to use it, feel free to clone it.


## Instructions


After cloning this repository, you can install the application by navigating into the project folder and using the following command:


```
yarn
```


```
yarn start
```
